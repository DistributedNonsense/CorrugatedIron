# README - CorrugatedIron.Tests.Deprecated

This project contains tests for deprecated/soon to be removed features.
Currently only Legacy Search Live Tests exist here, because you can't use them alongside some of the new Yokozuna features.
To run these tests, you will need to add an `advanced.config` file to Riak's `/etc` dir to enable Legacy Search. You can find an example of this file in `sample.advanced.config`.
