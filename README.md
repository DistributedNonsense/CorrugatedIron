## Riak .NET Client Roadmap

### Cluster and node info
[Github Issue 10](https://github.com/basho/riak-dotnet-client/issues/10)
This would be looking for ways to get the results of `riak_admin status` and other commands through the Riak Client API

### SOLR Interface
[Github Issue 20](https://github.com/basho/riak-dotnet-client/issues/20)
Create an HTTP interface for [Faceted queries vi the Solr Interface](http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Querying.html#Faceted-Queries-via-the-Solr-Interface)

### Improved Riak Search API
[Github Issue 23](url:https://github.com/basho/riak-dotnet-client/issues/23) Additional development should be undertaken to make it easier for developers to use this.
